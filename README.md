# Q-Value

The following repositories hosts custom made Python code for the purpose of investigating the validity of an extended Q-value metric, created by H.B.G. Thomas (1963) trying to determine a link between the information content of an arithmetic question and the time taken to process and answer said question. Created by L.M.Booth at the University of Hull. 

## Repositories
The following repositories are all written in Python 3+ and utilises the kivy 1.11.1 GUI language for creating a user interface. The first link has anonimised participant data, a data plotter and a calculator for computing the extended Q-value across multiple carries for two number addition. The second link has the experimental software used to collect the experimental data as well as an sql database generator for every question between 0+0 and 9999+9999 with its relevant Q-value. Guides for installing required dependences and installation procedures can be found on the respective links:
